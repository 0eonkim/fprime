# F´ Tutorials

These tutorials will walk the user from a basic getting-started guide through designing a full system for use with F´. This will help new
users to learn F´ and walk through the most basic steps in running F´.

## Getting Started

A basic tutorial that will help the user start using F´, build and run a system, and learn the basic items in the system.
This will include looking through Ports, Components, and Topologies.

## Math Component

A tutorial that creates two trivial "math" components that illustrates the process of specifying ports, components, and topologies. It 
also shows developer implementation and unit tests. This is for the purposes of learning F´ without the need for embedded devices.

## Gps Tutorial

A tutorial covering the interaction with a real GPS receiver. This will cover how to design driver components, application components, 
and cross-compiling onto a Rasperry Pi. This will show how to build a more realistic embedded system and focuses on cross compiling.

## Full System Tutorial

A tutorial to cover building a full system in F´ for use on embedded systems. **Coming Soon**.
