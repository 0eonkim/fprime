== The MathSender Component

Now we can build and test the `MathSender` component.
There are five steps:

. Construct the FPP model.
. Add the model to the project.
. Build the model.
. Complete the implementation.
. Write and run unit tests.

=== Construct the FPP Model

*In directory Ref:*
Go to the directory `Ref` at the top-level of the
F Prime repository and run `mkdir MathSender`
to create a directory for the new component.

*In directory Ref/MathSender:*
Now go into the directory `Ref/MathSender`.
Create a file `MathSender.fpp` with the following contents:

[source,fpp]
----
include::../../../../Ref/MathSender/MathSender.fpp[]
----
