== Introduction

This tutorial shows how to develop, test, and deploy a simple topology
consisting of two components:

. `MathSender`: A component that receives commands and forwards work to `MathReceiver`.
. `MathReceiver`: A component that carries out arithmetic operations and returns the results
to `MathSender`.

See the diagram below.

*What is covered:* The tutorial covers the following concepts:

. Using the https://fprime-community.github.io/fpp[FPP modeling language]
to specify the types and ports used by the components.
. Using the F Prime build system to build the types and ports.
. Developing the `MathSender` component: Specifying the component,
building the component,
completing the {cpp} component implementation, and writing
component unit tests.
. Developing the `MathReceiver` component.
. Adding the new components and connections to the topology for the F Prime
`Ref` application.
. Using the F Prime Ground Data System (GDS) to run the updated `Ref`
application.

*Prerequisites:* This tutorial assumes the following:

. Basic knowledge of Unix: How to navigate in a shell and execute programs.
. Basic knowledge of git: How to create a branch.
. Basic knowledge of {cpp}, including class declarations, inheritance,
and virtual functions.

If you have not yet installed F Prime on your system, do so now.
Follow the installation guide at `INSTALL.md`
in the https://github.com/nasa/fprime[F Prime git repository].
You may also wish to work through the Getting Started tutorial at
`docs/GettingStarted/Tutorial.md`.

*Git branch:* This tutorial is designed to work on the branch `release/v3.0.0`.

Working on this tutorial will modify some files under version control in the
F Prime git repository.
Therefore it is a good idea to do this work on a new branch.
For example:

[source,bash]
----
% git checkout release/v3.0.0
% git checkout -b math-tutorial
----

If you wish, you can save your work by committing to this branch.
