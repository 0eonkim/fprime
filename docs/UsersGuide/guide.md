# The Discerning User's Guide to F´

F´ is an embedded systems framework developed at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory for use in space based missions. Its
goal is simple: make development of flight-quality embedded software simple, easy, and fun. F´ reduces the complexity
and overhead to develop such systems.

This guide is intended to expose the features of F´ and seek to allow users and developers to take advantage of all F´
has to offer. It is broken down into a getting started, users manual, best practices, developer documentation, and API
documentation sections.

The Getting Started section points initiates to all the items needed to get up and running with F´. Since these are
often needed before a user searches for a user's guide, this section merely links to the stand-alone version of those
items.

The User's Manual section helps users of this framework understand the concepts of F´ and build more complex projects
using the Framework. It is where users should go to understand more about what is possible in F´.

The Best Practices section collects best practices and patterns many projects use while developing F´. Users who consult
this section will learn how to organize F´ projects and implementations to solve problems using standard and recommended
techniques.

The Developer Documentation is intended for developers who want to use some of the advanced features of F´, understand
how the framework is organized internally, and otherwise dig deep into F´ concepts and implementation. Anyone who wishes
to extend or change F´ should consult this section.

The API documentation section contains the automatically generated documentation on F´.

**Note:** currently this documentation is being assembled. Please feel free to contribute!
