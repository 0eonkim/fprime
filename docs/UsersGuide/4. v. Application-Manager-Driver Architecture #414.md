**4. Concepts of F′**

**v. Application-Manager-Driver Architecture**

**Standard F´ applications typically break down into various** **layers.
This is such that standard software layering techniques can be applied
to F´ applications. Each layer is dependent on layers below it, however;
these layers do not depend on layers above them. These layers are
composed of individual modules that represent concrete units of
functionality. These units have defined interfaces for communicating
with other components. In F´ these interfaces are the list of ports the
component uses.**

**a. Software System Architecture**

The software system architecture is designed to break down software into
modules. These modules provide separation of function, definition of
interfaces, behavioral characteristics (e.g., rate groups, concurrency,
data flow), testing at the unit level, and ownership. These modules are
known as Components in F´ and all external functions of the component
are defined as an interface for interacting with it. In F´ the
component’s port list is its external interface. In addition,
initialization functions and Construtors allow for setup and
construction from the main thread.

**b. Software Layers**

Software layering allows separation of concerns by: implementing logic
for single layers; allowing for software module reusability across
projects and platforms; replacing layers with new code supporting the
same interface for new drivers or managers, and simulation; testing at
own layer with stubs for lower levels; and fault protection handled at
the appropriate layer. In addition layering allows for decoupling code
dependencies, as upper layers depend down the later stack, but layers do
not depend up the stack.

**c. Component Model**

The F′ component architecture is a design pattern to assemble F´
applications through layers of components. This help F´ support the
module and layer architectural patterns. There are typically three
layers and F´application or project: i) application, ii) manager, and
iii) driver. These layers are further discussed below, and an example is
shown in Figure 1. Each layer defines components for only that layer’s
functionality.

**1. Application Component**

The application layer implements mission specific use of the peripheral
(and other components), and does not know the driver to get to the
peripheral. It represents system logic that uses peripherals and other
components to perform the behavior of the full F´ application. In our
example, the application level performs the function of a robotic arm,
however; it only knows that the arm is composed of servos, but knows
nothing of the hardware interface to run those servos.

**2. Manager Component**

The manager layer manages a particular peripheral by using the interface
driver at the abstract level (through the driver’s interface of ports).
The manager does not know how the peripheral will be used by the
application. It does not even know that it is used at all by the
Application. However, the manager does know of the driver that is used
to talk to its peripheral. In our example, a servo manager is defined
that knows how to control servos through a driver and provides a generic
servo interface to any application that might use servos.

**3. Driver Component**

The driver layer is dedicated to a particular hardware interface. It is
written to interact with only that device, and does not need to know the
use of hardware at the other end. The driver provides an interface to
the hardware device (I2C), but not an interface to the servo. It is up
to the manager to know how to control the servo via the driver. In our
example the driver runs an I2C bus.
