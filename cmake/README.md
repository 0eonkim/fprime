# F` CMake Build System

Stock F´ ships with a bispoke makesystem ensure that building is done correctly and in the correct order. However, using and mantaining this build
system presents a steep learning curve to new users of F´. This included CMake system is intended as an eventual replacement to the existing build
system that should be easier to learn and use. In addition, the use of cmake puts F´more in line with standard C++ development.

Since this CMake system ships along-side the original make system, certain caveats must be understood before beigining to use CMake. These caveats
should dissappear after CMake replaces the original make system in its entirety

### CMakes Caveats

1. CMake should not be used in tandem with the original make system.  If it is needed to switch between make systems, perform a `git clean` command
   or otherwise remove generated files.
2. CMake in-source builds will be dangerous as auto-generated CMake Makefiles will clobber the existing make system. Use CMake out-of-source builds
   until the old make system is replaced.
3. CMake UTs collide with existing UTs. Thus a cmake `make check` may not fully pass. 

## Getting Started Using CMake and F`

CMake as a system auto-generates OS-specific make files for building F´. Once these file are generated, standard make tools can be run to perform
the compiling, asebmling, linking etc. Building a CMake-enabled deployment comes down to just a small number of step:

1. Make a directory to build in
2. Call CMake to generate make-files
3. Engage OS-specific make system (Linux and Mac OS X examples provided)
  1. Build the Deployment
  2. (Optional) Run the Deployment's Unit Tests

### Make Build Directory and Generate CMake Files

The following commands will create a new build directory and generate CMake files. Separate builds (for different OS targets, or different build
configurations) should be isolated in their own build-directories.  These directories can be achived as build-artifacts, but are typically not
added to source managment (Git).

Below, a user-provided deployment directory could be substituted for `Ref` below in-order to build a different deployment.

```
# Make a build directory and change directory into it
mkdir fprime/build-dir
cd fprime/build-dir
# Run CMake to generate CMake Files (Specifically for the Ref App)
cmake ../Ref/
```

### Building Deployments (Linux, Mac OS X)

Once generated by CMake, the cmake files typicall do not need to be re-generated. If new configuration is needed, a separate (new) build
directory should be used.  If changes occur to the CMake system, running the following steps will rerun the CMake file generation. Thus,
the above step can be run one time.  Rebuilding and iteration can be done with the following simple steps:

```
# Build the application (Will regenerate CMake if necessary)
make
# Build and run the UTs (if desired)
make check
```

**Note:** for the time-being, the application must be built before attempting to build and run the UTs.
