\param AI_XML: path to AI XML used for serializable parsing
\return SERIAL_NS (set in outer scope)


## AC Wrapper:

Note: as the autocoder is rewritten, this will likely need to change.
\param AC_TYPE: serializable, port, component, or topology
\param AC_FINAL_SOURCE: final position of the CPP file
\param AC_FINAL_HEADER: final position of the HPP file
\param AI_XML: AI xml input to autocoder
